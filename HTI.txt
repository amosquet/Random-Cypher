To implement RCCG into any program you only need two things, import RCCg and use encode and decode.

If you don't know how to import do:
    import RCCG
Do this at the top of your script or any place before calling the encode or decode functions.

To encode messages:
    RCCG.encode()

To decode messages:
    RCCG.decode()


Encode Example:

    message = "Hello World"

    encoded = RCCG.encode(message)

    print(encoded)

The above will encode whatever text the message variable is set to and then print the output.

Decode Example:

    message = "0100100001100101011011000110110001101111001000000101011101101111011100100110110001100100"

    decoded = RCCG.decode(message)

    print(decoded)

The above will decode whatever input the message variable is set to and then print the output.
NOTE: the example text for the message variable is not representative of what the encoded messages look like.

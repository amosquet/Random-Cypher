# Random-Cypher
A program that "encrypts" messages so that randos can't just read them, it can also reverse it.

This is the RCCG(Random Ceasar Cypher Generator). Meant to simplify the creation of "encrypted" messages allong with decoding them.

Intermeiate versions ex; 2.5 and 2.5.1 , will not have fully cotained versions of the program and will insead contain the dist and contained version of the latest FULL release

Anybody can suggest or even modify it just let me know if you plan on doing it and share your own version with me, I'd love to see what else other people can think of
